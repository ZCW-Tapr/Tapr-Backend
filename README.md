# Tapr: Gesture-Driven Smart Device Orchestration

Tapr is a contextual automation framework built for intuitive smart home control using gesture recognition and device mapping. With modular backend architecture and scalable entity relationships, Tapr serves as a foundation for responsive user-device ecosystems.

Note: Proprietary gesture orchestration logic and behavioral mapping models are reserved for private development and are not disclosed in this repository.

## Purpose
Tapr is a contextual gesture-driven smart home system designed for adaptive device control and cross-platform automation.  
It simplifies device coordination through contextual automation‚Äîbuilt for smart homes and gesture-based control.

## Status
Core backend structure in place, gesture services in progress. Architecture optimized for scale and user flexibility.
The full gesture orchestration logic is under development and will be released in alignment with Tapr's prototype showcase.
